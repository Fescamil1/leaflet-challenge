Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet. This homework uses both html and JavaScript to visualize  United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake data. 

Level 1: Basic Visualization

Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and picked the "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data to visualize. Got URL (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) to use the JSON to pull the data from. 

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
