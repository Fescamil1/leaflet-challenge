Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet. This homework uses both html and JavaScript to visualize  United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake data. 

Level 1: Basic Visualization

Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and picked the "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" data to visualize. Got URL (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) to use the JSON to pull the data from. 

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
